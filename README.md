## The Problem
Tools for doing Open Source Projects with Cancer Data don't actually enable the everyday developer try to do the job easily. Tools require approvals and logins before access is granted, tools that do provide open access don't have a Web API to systematically pull down the data or provide a bulk download feature. To navigate this industry is extremely complex and is not unified in a way that is easily found online searching or documented at the sub platforms of each for users to get back to. This causes less adoption and thus less people looking to solve the problem.

There needs to be a group that works to coordinate all of these tools and datasets so that people can more easily become engaged in this industry to solve the problem. Either this, or a new tool needs to enter the market that can take over these existing datasets and manage them going forward in a way that is more conducive to individuals and groups who want to use the data.

### Currently Available Data Tools and Problems with Use
- https://datascience.cancer.gov (Must be senior professor as of now or involved in an organization)
- https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdc-docs (TONS of data at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/, but some is unusable/not available due to must be an organization to get an account to download data)
- https://seer.cancer.gov/about/ (requires proprietary client, no raw download/usage)
- https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/seer-mhos/obtain/overview.html SEER Linked Databases (SEER data combined with other data sources, requires project approval)
- http://www.caisis.org (only web based client)
- https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/tools.htm (Large collection of other tools, not fully vetted yet)
- https://gis.cancer.gov (large not fully vetted, maps of the data) (At least one of the apps here requires manual clicking to get to a dataset, then is available for download.
- https://gis.cancer.gov/ (multiple useful tools, all require manual clicking and then download to get raw data for use)
- https://no-smoke.org/materials-services/lists-maps/#1555694220625-13093c40-f073
- https://www.naaccr.org/ (manual clicking and download required, not good format once downloaded)
- https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/cancer/ncdb (requires login and no documented process online to do this was found)
- https://dcc.icgc.org/repositories (requires login and approvals from NCI)
- https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/ (requires login/approvals)
- http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool (open for use but manual downloads and searching)
- https://projectdatasphere.org (requires login)
- https://www.cbioportal.org (Web api available but not comprehensive, bad data formatting, not json)
### Avaialable Curated Lists from Other Developers I Found
- https://github.com/beamandrew/medical-data (some cancer stuff here, some requires login, nothing stood out on first glance)
